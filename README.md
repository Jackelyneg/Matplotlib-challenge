Sample Drug Quartiles


### Tools used:
- Pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- scipy.stats
- numpy
- sklearn


Observations

- Based on the bar graph, there were more mice tested on Ramicane and Capomulin

- Based on the pie chart, there i a higher percentage of male mice than female mice that were used in this study

- Based on the correlation coefficient between Weight and Tumor volume, we can state that the correlation is high. A number close to 1.0 shows a high strength in a relationship between the two variables. Here we see a positive correlation between the two variables. As weight increases so does the Average tumor volume.
